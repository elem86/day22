# Day 22

🎯 Day 22 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🔍 Customer Churn Detector using SQL

Today’s project was all about identifying inactive customers who haven’t interacted with a telecom service in the last 30 days.


📌 What I did:

  - Created a mock customer activity database with interactions across 2025.

  - Used julianday() to calculate days since last interaction.

  - Built a SQL view (churn_candidates) to isolate users at risk.

  - Segmented results by region and plan type to uncover patterns in churn.
  - 

📊 Key Insights:

  - Certain regions and lower-tier plans show higher churn risk.

  - Many customers haven't interacted in over 60 days — prime targets for re-engagement.
  - 

💡 This kind of SQL-based churn detection can help marketing teams focus their efforts on retaining valuable customers.
